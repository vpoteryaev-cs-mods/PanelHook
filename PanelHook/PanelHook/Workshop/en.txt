[h1]Panel Hook (beta) for modders[/h1]
[b]This mod is designed for modders. If you are not a modder, just subscribe to this mod and allow it in the game if it is stated as the dependency in another mod.[/b]

[h1]Forewords[/h1]
When writing your own mod, too many time is spent on placing and precise positioning, let's say, buttons on the building information panel.
Then may happens that another mod also places something in the same panel, overlapping your changes ... or the developers have changed something ... etc.
As an example, when using very useful ModTools, it's annoys sometimes that the buttons and labels of the mod on the panels overlap with the other labels, and sometimes the interaction elements.

This mod will allow you to minimize your time-wasting, and unify the interaction of users with different mods, without changing anything in the panels.

[h1]Purpose[h1]
With this mod, although called [b]Panel[/b]Hook, you'll be able to attach your own mouse click handler to any element derived from the UIComponent.
You just have to define the element you are interested and provide the PanelHook with the following:
[olist]
	[*] Your handler - it's standard ColossalFramework.UI.MouseEventHandler.
	[*] Element itself (mod accepts 'object' class type).
	[*] The description that will be displayed to the user in the drop-down list for selection when clicking on an element.
[/olist]
As a result, when you click on an element, the panel will appear with the drop-down list of actions and the handler will be called accordingly after choosing action.
One handler can be hooked to different elements, also several different handlers can be attached to one element.
Only full duplication the pair handler-element is not allowed.
